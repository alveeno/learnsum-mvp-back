# Backend Gap Analysis — frontend features the backend doesn't support yet

Produced by reading the **actual frontend code** (`learnsum-mvp-expo-app`) and
comparing it to this backend. Nothing has been built. This is a decision sheet:
for each gap I give a recommendation, and **you make the final call** (✅ build /
🕓 defer / ❌ skip) in the right-hand column.

> **The key framing:** the frontend's own docs say the tutor-home shell is a
> **prototype with sample data** (`tutorData.ts` is "sample/placeholder content,
> NOT a backend shape"). So a feature appearing on screen does **not** mean it was
> meant to be a real product feature. The hard part isn't listing them — it's you
> deciding which prototype ideas become real. That's what this doc is for.

**Effort key:** S = small (hours) · M = medium (a day or two) · L = large (a
project of its own). **Depends on** = can't be built until that other gap is.

---

> ✅ **Group A (A1–A5) is now BUILT and LIVE** — migration `0014_tutor_profile_extras.sql`
> (applied) + updates to `/api/onboarding`, `/api/tutor/subjects`, and `/api/tutors/[slug]`.
> **Also built since** (during frontend wiring): `0015` (taxonomy reseeded to mirror the app's
> subject slugs) and `0016` (per-subject lesson `format`/`districts` — stored now; **TODO:** use
> it in matching). Frontend wiring of all this is underway — see `FRONTEND_WIRING.md`.
>
> **Found during wiring (recorded in `plan.md §7`):** (1) ~~the subject *edit* endpoint
> `PUT /api/tutor/subjects` still expects `{en,zh}` objects, but the app sends arrays for
> `achievements`/`qualifications` — editing subjects would reject them~~ **FIXED** (profile-edit
> wiring): `PUT /api/tutor/subjects` now accepts array `qualifications`/`exam_results` AND persists
> per-subject `format` + `districts` (it had neither), and `PATCH /api/profiles/me` now accepts the
> `lgbt` gender — so the Profile "Change preferences" edit save is lossless; (2) `tutoring_type`
> (individual/group) isn't collected by the app, so it's stored null.

---

> 🗓️ **Update (Jun 25) — the frontend moved well past this doc.** Since it was written, the frontend
> built the **seeker (student/parent) app shell** (`/feed`: an Instagram-style **post feed**, Search +
> Quick Match, Saved, Account — all **sample data**), a real public **`/tutors/[slug]`** route (reuses
> the existing `GET /api/tutors/[slug]` — **no new gap**), the **student/parent final account step**
> (`CreateAccount` → `POST /api/onboarding`), plus sound effects and a tutor logout button (no backend).
> New/changed gaps are collected in **Group H** below.
>
> **Key correction:** `POST /api/onboarding` **already fully supports `student` and `parent`** (it
> branches by role and writes via the `complete_onboarding` RPC, migration 0009) — so seeker onboarding
> is a **frontend payload-shape fix (H1), NOT a backend gap.** Also **Instagram was dropped** from
> contact (WhatsApp + WeChat only) — any "IG" mention below is stale.

> ✅ **Build round 2 (Jun 26) — BUILT:** **B1** (post likes), **D1/D2/D4** (search filters: age,
> gender, + multi-district & language on `GET /api/tutors`), **H3** (saved/bookmarked tutors), and the
> backend half of **B2** (in-app chat: Realtime + read receipts). **H2** decision: **leave seeker Home
> as-is** for now (no backend change). Migrations `0017_saved_tutors.sql` + `0018_chat_realtime.sql`
> are **applied** (by you). Per-item status is in each section below; what still needs **frontend wiring**
> is called out inline and summarised at the bottom. Parked (product decisions): C (follows/stories/
> ratings/sessions/verification), E (analytics/payments), F (notifications).
>
> ✅ **Verified end-to-end (Jun 26):** a 50-check live HTTP suite (likes / filters / saved / chat) all
> passing against the live DB. **Bug found + fixed during verification:** the `likes_count` counter never
> moved because the `0001` trigger ran as the liker and RLS `posts: owner update` blocked a non-owner's
> bump — fixed in **`0019_counter_triggers_security_definer.sql`** (applied). `liked`/`liked_by_me` were
> always fine; only the denormalized count was stuck.

> ✅ **Rounds 3–5 (Jun 28 – Jul 1) — BUILT + LIVE (migrations `0019`–`0031` all applied):**
> - **Subdistrict locations** (`0021`) — search now matches at subdistrict level.
> - **Seeker profile fields** (`0022`/`0023`, was **H5**): `profiles.bio`/`phone` + student `education` jsonb — round-trip on onboarding **and** the Account edit.
> - **Subscription tiers & contact gating** (`0024`/`0025`, was **Group I**): `tutor_profiles.tier` + `tutor_contact_unlocks` (daily quota, permanent unlocks) + **server-side chat reply gating**.
> - **Seeker read / privacy / search** (`0026`–`0030`): `profile_views` ("who viewed you"), `saved_people` (tutor-side mixed saves), `child_profiles.age`, `is_discoverable`/`share_personal_info` toggles, and the `get_seeker_for_tutor` / `search_seekers` RPCs (`GET /api/seekers[/id]`); `0030` revokes them from `anon`.
> - **"Account information" section** (`0031`): seeker `wechat_id` on `profiles` (`PATCH /api/profiles/me`); tutors keep `tutor_profiles.wechat_id`. Change-password is **UI-only** (no endpoint).
> - **Session persistence** (routes only, no migration): `POST /api/auth/refresh` (refresh-token flow, wired into `apiFetch`'s 401 retry) + `POST /api/auth/logout` now **revokes** the refresh token(s) server-side.
>
> **Status correction:** Group I below still says "migrations NOT yet applied" — **stale**; `0024`–`0030` (through `0031`) are **live + verified**. `list_migrations` under-reports (most were applied manually via the SQL editor) — the live schema (`list_tables`) is authoritative.

---

## A. Onboarding data you already collect but the backend discards

These are the most important, because a tutor **fills them in today and the answers
vanish on save**. You're already asking for them — the only question is whether to
keep them.

### A1 — Tutor teaching levels  ·  ✅ Build (S)
- **Frontend:** `TutorTeachLevels` screen ("Who do you teach?") — multi-select of the
  6 levels, stored as `tutor:levels`. `TutorSD` even shows them on its review screen.
- **Backend:** no column/table. `POST /api/onboarding` explicitly reports them as
  *"no DB home yet"* and drops them.
- **Why build:** which levels a tutor teaches is core info for display and matching.
  Cheap to add (a `tutor_levels` table or a `text[]` column).

### A2 — Per-subject "relevant experience" list  ·  ✅ Build (S)
- **Frontend:** `TutorSD` collects, per subject, an `experiences[]` list (text +
  duration/event + ongoing flag + year).
- **Backend:** no column; onboarding drops it.
- **Why build:** it's part of the tutor's selling story (already on the "Strengths &
  Details" screen). Add a `jsonb` column on `tutor_subcategories`. *(Alternative: ❌
  remove the field from the screen if you've decided it's clutter.)*

### A3 — Education history + "currently studying"  ·  🕓 Decide (M)
- **Frontend:** `TutorAbout` collects a **multi-school** education history (one block
  per level — kindergarten/primary/secondary/university — each with institution +
  qualification + score) **plus** a "currently studying" list (institution + programme).
- **Backend:** only a single `tutor_profiles.university` text field.
- **Decision:** the frontend is much richer than the backend here. Either (a) store the
  whole history as `jsonb` on `tutor_profiles` (keeps the screen), or (b) simplify the
  screen to one "university" field (drops the richness). My lean: **(a) jsonb**, since
  the screen is already built and education is a credibility signal.

### A4 — Gender value mismatch  ·  ✅ Build (S)
- **Frontend:** offers `male / female / lgbtq / na`.
- **Backend:** enum is `male / female / other / prefer_not_to_say`.
- **Fix:** either add `lgbt` to the backend enum (if you want it as a real category) or
  map `lgbtq→other`, `na→prefer_not_to_say`. A product/wording decision, tiny to do.

### A5 — First/last name vs single name  ·  ✅ Build (S)
- **Frontend:** `TutorAbout` collects **first name + last name** separately (both required).
- **Backend:** has `full_name` and `display_name`.
- **Fix:** the save step should combine them (e.g. `full_name = "First Last"`). Trivial,
  but needs deciding so names actually persist.

---

## B. Engagement that already has backend schema (switch on)

### B1 — Post likes  ·  ✅ DONE (S)
- **Frontend:** the feed has a working like button (red pop + count) in `FeedScreen`.
- **Backend:** `post_likes` table + `likes_count` triggers **already existed** — added the endpoint.
- **Built (no migration needed):** `src/app/api/posts/[id]/likes/route.ts`
  - `POST /api/posts/[id]/likes` — like (idempotent; already-liked → 200, fresh → 201)
  - `DELETE /api/posts/[id]/likes` — unlike (idempotent)
  - `GET /api/posts/[id]/likes` — `{ liked, likes_count }` (public; `liked=false` when signed out)
  - Plus `GET /api/tutors/[slug]/posts` now returns **`liked_by_me`** per post (so the heart shows
    filled/empty on load for a signed-in viewer).
- **🔌 Needs frontend wiring:** the like button is currently bound to sample/local state — point it at
  these endpoints (and read `liked_by_me` from the posts feed). *(Frontend removed comments; backend
  comment schema stays dormant.)*
- **⚠️ Fixed during verification (migration 0019):** `likes_count` wasn't incrementing — the `0001`
  counter trigger ran as the liker and RLS blocked a non-owner from updating the post. Made the counter
  functions `SECURITY DEFINER`. Live tests now pass (0 → like → 1 → unlike → 0).

### B2 — In-app chat  ·  ✅ DONE + frontend wired (M)
- **🔌 Frontend wired (Jun 27, REST polling):** shared `components/chat/ChatList` + `ChatThread`, standalone
  routes `app/messages/index.tsx` + `app/messages/[id].tsx`, a **"Message"** button on the tutor profile
  (`startConversation` → thread), unread badges, and mark-read on open. The thread polls every 3s, the list
  every 5s — the app has no Supabase client, so the **Realtime publication from 0018 is currently unused**
  (its `messages` read-receipt RLS *is* used). Upgrading to true Realtime later = add `@supabase/supabase-js`
  + a channel subscription; no backend change needed.

- **Frontend:** `ChatScreen` is a full conversation UI (sample data).
- **Backend (was):** `conversations`/`messages` tables, RLS, AND endpoints all already existed — the only
  missing pieces were live delivery + read state. **Now built:**
  - `0018_chat_realtime.sql` — adds `conversations` + `messages` to the **`supabase_realtime`**
    publication (so the app can subscribe to new messages live; RLS still scopes the stream to
    participants) + a `messages` UPDATE policy so read receipts are allowed.
  - `GET /api/conversations` now returns **`unread_count`** per conversation (for list badges).
  - `PATCH /api/conversations/[id]/messages` — marks messages you *received* as read ("opened chat").
  - (`POST /api/conversations` + `POST .../messages` already existed and are unchanged.)
- **🔌 Needs frontend (this is the bulk of B2):** build the real `ChatScreen` against these endpoints, a
  **Realtime subscription** to `messages` (Supabase JS `.channel(...).on('postgres_changes', …)`), a
  conversations list using `unread_count`, a "Message" button on the tutor profile that calls
  `POST /api/conversations`, and a call to the `PATCH …/messages` mark-read when a thread is opened.
  (Until wired, contact stays WhatsApp + WeChat.)

---

## C. Social-graph / vanity features — prototype, decide if real

This whole group is the prototype's "make it feel like Instagram" layer. None of it
exists in the backend, and each is a meaningful new system. **These are genuine product
decisions, not just engineering.**

### C1 — Follows / "Connect" / follower counts  ·  🕓 Defer (L)
- **Frontend:** "Connect" buttons, `following` state, `followers` counts everywhere.
- **Backend:** no follow/social graph at all.
- **Why defer:** following changes the product model (a social network vs a directory).
  Decide whether tutors following each other is actually a goal before building it.

### C2 — Stories (24-hour)  ·  ❌ Skip (M)
- **Frontend:** "Your story" + a stories row.
- **Backend:** stores permanent **posts**, not ephemeral stories.
- **Why skip:** posts already cover "share content." Ephemeral stories add an expiry/
  media system for little marketplace value. Revisit only if engagement needs it.

### C3 — "Tutors you may know"  ·  🕓 Defer (M)
- **Frontend:** a strip suggesting other tutors from your **university** (+ `mutual` count).
- **Backend:** matching is seeker→tutor by subject/etc — no tutor→tutor suggestions.
- **Why defer:** depends on C1 (follows) to be meaningful; low priority.

### C4 — Ratings & reviews  ·  🕓 Defer (L)
- **Frontend:** every tutor has a `rating` (e.g. 4.7★) and a min-rating filter.
- **Backend:** no reviews/ratings.
- **Why defer (but important):** trust is central to a marketplace, so this matters
  eventually — but it needs rules (who can review? after what? moderation?). Worth a
  dedicated design later, not a quick add.

### C5 — "Successful sessions" count  ·  ❌ Skip (L)
- **Frontend:** a `sessions` stat + filter (e.g. "280 sessions").
- **Backend:** no bookings/sessions exist (contact is off-platform via WhatsApp).
- **Why skip:** you can't count sessions you don't broker. Only revisit if you add
  in-app booking.

### C6 — "Qualified" verification badge  ·  🕓 Defer (M)
- **Frontend:** a green "Qualified" badge ("earned through LearnSum's own verification").
- **Backend:** no verification system (already on your TODO).
- **Why defer:** needs a real review/approval flow. Until then the badge is cosmetic.

---

## D. Search / browse filters

The frontend's advanced filter sheet (`FilterSheet`) offers: **price, age, rating,
years, sessions, followers, mode, districts, gender**. The backend's `GET /api/tutors`
currently filters only by subcategory, district, format, type, and rate.

### D1 — Filter by age  ·  ✅ DONE (S) — `GET /api/tutors?min_age=&max_age=` (reads `profiles.age`).
### D2 — Filter by gender  ·  ✅ DONE (S) — `GET /api/tutors?gender=` (reads `profiles.gender`; accepts
`male|female|other|prefer_not_to_say|lgbt`).
### D3 — Rating / years / sessions / followers filters  ·  🕓 Depends on C — these can't
work until ratings (C4), follows (C1) and sessions (C5) exist. (Years-of-experience is
partial — derivable from per-subject data.)
### D4 — Extend browse to the full set  ·  ✅ DONE (M) — `GET /api/tutors` now also takes
**`?language=`** (comma-separated; matches a tutor who teaches ANY, via `tutor_languages`) and
**multi-`?district=`** (comma-separated enum codes). Price (`min_rate`/`max_rate`), mode
(`tutoring_format`), type (`tutoring_type`) and subject (`subcategory_id`) already existed.
- **🔌 Needs frontend wiring:** the `FilterSheet` already has these controls — map them to the new query
  params (age range, gender, language list, multi-district) when calling `GET /api/tutors`. **Note:**
  send district **enum codes** (e.g. `CentralWestern`), not labels — the app must map label→code first
  (see plan.md §4.10). *(Rating/years/sessions/followers controls stay inert — they're D3, parked.)*

---

## E. Analytics & payments

### E1 — Analytics dashboard  ·  🕓 Defer (L)
- **Frontend:** `AnalyticsScreen` shows profile views, post reach, new followers, and a
  "who viewed you" list (all behind a premium paywall).
- **Backend:** none of this — no view tracking, no event analytics, no follower counts.
- **Why defer:** needs an event-tracking system + the social counts from group C. Big.

### E2 — Premium / in-app payments  ·  🕓 Defer (L)
- **Frontend:** the Analytics tab is gated behind an "Upgrade to Premium" paywall.
- **Backend:** no payments, no subscriptions, no entitlements.
- **Why defer:** a major project (Stripe / Apple-Google IAP, billing, entitlement
  checks). Decide the business model before any of it.

---

## F. Notifications

### F1 — Activity / notifications  ·  ❌ Skip (already out)
- **Frontend:** a heart icon with a red activity dot (no `/notifications` route).
- **Backend:** `push_tokens`/`notifications` tables exist but unused; explicitly out.
- **Why skip:** already a deliberate non-feature. Leave the dot cosmetic.

---

## G. Minor shape mismatches

### G1 — Post kinds  ·  ❌ Skip / tiny
- **Frontend:** post media kinds include `whiteboard` and `quote`.
- **Backend:** `post_media.media_type` is `image`/`video`; `post_type` is
  `update`/`showcase`/`result`.
- **Fix:** map `whiteboard`→image and `quote`→a text post, or ignore — purely cosmetic.

---

## H. Seeker (student/parent) app — new since this doc (Jun 25)

The frontend's `/feed` is no longer a placeholder — it's a 4-tab seeker shell (Home post-feed /
Search + Quick Match / Saved / Account), built front-end-only with **sample data** (it reuses the
tutor prototype's `tutorData.ts`). As with the tutor-home shell, "on screen" ≠ "a committed product
feature" — these are the decisions.

### H1 — Student/parent onboarding persistence  ·  ✅ Frontend fix — DONE + verified (S)
- **Status:** ✅ **Fixed on the frontend** (`seekerOnboardingPayload.ts`) **and verified end-to-end
  (2026-06-26)** — a fresh student/parent signup completes onboarding and the rows land in the DB. The
  `CreateAccount` step creates the account and `POST /api/onboarding` saves the answers in the correct
  shape, **with no backend change**.
- **What was wrong (NOT a backend gap):** `POST /api/onboarding` already handles `student` and `parent`
  in full (writes prefs + interests + availability, and for parents the child rows, via
  `complete_onboarding`). The frontend payload had the **wrong shape**, so the (best-effort) save
  silently failed. Corrected:
  - `education_level` → **`school_level`**.
  - `interests` were objects `{subcategory, category, label}` → now an array of subject **slug strings**
    (e.g. `["mathematics", "basketball"]` — slugs match since migration 0015).
  - parent payload nested top-level `children` → now **`parent: { searching_for_self, children: [...] }`**.
- *(Budget isn't collected in seeker onboarding, so `budget_max_per_hour` stays null — fine.)*

### H2 — Seeker post-feed endpoint  ·  🕓 Decide (M)
- **Frontend:** the seeker **Home** tab is an Instagram-style stream of tutor **posts** (sample data).
- **Backend:** `GET /api/feed` returns **tutor cards** (display name / subjects / district, either
  personalized via `match_tutors_for_seeker` or latest-first), **not** a stream of posts. No cross-tutor
  post-stream endpoint exists.
- **Decision:** either (a) build a post-stream feed (aggregate published tutors' posts), or (b) make the
  seeker Home a **tutor-card** feed off the existing `/api/feed` and keep post browsing on each tutor's
  profile. My lean: **(b)** for now — `/api/feed` already exists with real matching, a post-stream is a
  bigger build, and the post-feed is the deferred browse surface.

### H3 — Saved / bookmarked tutors  ·  ✅ DONE (S)
- **Frontend:** a **Saved** tab bookmarks tutors (in-memory, session-only via a small store).
- **Built:** `0017_saved_tutors.sql` (`saved_tutors` table, owner-only RLS) + endpoints:
  - `GET /api/saved` — your bookmarked tutors as cards (same shape as `/api/tutors`, newest-saved first,
    each with `id`, `slug`, `saved_at`). Tutors who later unpublish drop out of the cards but keep the row.
  - `POST /api/saved` — body `{ tutor_id }` **or** `{ slug }`; idempotent.
  - `DELETE /api/saved/[id]` — `[id]` is the tutor's uuid **or** slug; idempotent.
- **🔌 Needs frontend wiring:** replace the in-memory Saved store with these endpoints (save on
  bookmark-tap → `POST`, un-save → `DELETE`, Saved tab list → `GET`). Any signed-in role can save.

### H4 — Seeker saved search filters  ·  ❌ Skip / optional (S)
- **Frontend:** the Search tab's advanced filters now persist across restarts via **AsyncStorage**
  (device-local) — no backend needed.
- **Backend:** a `/api/filters` route already exists if you ever want filters synced across devices.
- **Why skip:** device-local is fine for a single-device user; only wire it to the backend if
  cross-device sync becomes a goal.

### H5 — Seeker profile fields (name / gender / photo / bio / phone / education)  ·  ✅ Build — implemented (S)
- **Frontend:** new `app/onboarding/SeekerAbout.tsx` (the `TutorAbout` analogue) collects the
  student/parent's **name, gender, photo, bio, phone** and (students only) a single **education
  level**. It runs as the last onboarding step before `CreateAccount` **and** as the Account-tab
  **Edit profile** screen (`mode=edit` → `PATCH /api/profiles/me`). Name + gender required; rest optional.
- **Already worked (verified by reading the code):** `POST /api/onboarding` persists name + gender
  (`normalizeGender`); `PATCH /api/profiles/me` already accepts the `student.school_level` block + the
  mapped gender; and `GET /api/auth/me` already returns `gender` and (for students) `school_level`
  under **`detail.student_profile`** — **no change needed** in `me`.
- **Built this round (Jun 28):** the only real gaps were `bio` / `phone` (no column) and `avatar_url`
  at onboarding (the RPC never wrote it).
  - **Migration `0022_profile_bio_phone.sql`** — `profiles += bio text, phone text`, and
    `CREATE OR REPLACE complete_onboarding` whose profile `UPDATE` now also writes
    `avatar_url` / `bio` / `phone`. **Based on the current 0021 function body (NOT 0009)** so it keeps
    the tutor levels/education/format/district + seeker district-array writes intact.
  - **`POST /api/onboarding`** — `profilePayload` now also reads `avatar_url` / `bio` / `phone`.
  - **`PATCH /api/profiles/me`** — now accepts + persists `bio` / `phone` (empty string clears).
- **Follow-up (Jun 28) — student school HISTORY:** SeekerAbout now also lets STUDENTS enter a full
  per-level school history (the same `EducationSection` UI as tutors), kept ALONGSIDE the single
  `school_level` (which still drives matching). Stored as jsonb, mirroring `tutor_profiles.education`:
  - **Migration `0023_seeker_education.sql`** — `student_profiles += education jsonb`, and
    `CREATE OR REPLACE complete_onboarding` (based on the **current 0022** body) so the student
    INSERT/UPDATE also writes `education`.
  - **`POST /api/onboarding`** — `resolved.student` now carries `education`.
  - **`PATCH /api/profiles/me`** — the `student` block now accepts `education` (jsonb).
  - `GET /api/auth/me` still needs no change (`student_profile` is `select('*')`).
- **✅ Live + verified (Jun 28):** migrations `0022` and `0023` are **both applied**. End-to-end HTTP
  suite passing against the live DB — name/gender/avatar/bio/phone + school_level + the full school
  history round-trip through onboarding (`POST /api/onboarding`) **and** the Account-tab edit
  (`PATCH /api/profiles/me`), read back via `GET /api/auth/me`. (Heads-up: `next dev`'s file watcher
  did not hot-reload the route edits — a dev-server **restart** was needed to pick them up.)

## 🔌 Frontend wiring (`learnsum-mvp-expo-app`) — status

| Item | Frontend status | Endpoint(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **D1/D2/D4 filters** | ✅ **Wired** — **both** the seeker (Jun 26) **and tutor** (Jun 27) Search tabs query the backend; `FilterSheet` price/age/mode/district/gender → query params (districts mapped label→enum code; gender multi). Unsupported sliders (rating/years/sessions/followers = D3) hidden. | `GET /api/tutors?min_age=&max_age=&gender=&language=&district=&min_rate=&max_rate=&tutoring_format=` |
| **H3 saved** | ✅ **Wired (Jun 26)** — `savedTutors` store is backend-backed (optimistic save/unsave); Saved tab lists `GET /api/saved`. Keyed by tutor slug. | `GET`/`POST /api/saved`, `DELETE /api/saved/[id]` |
| **B1 likes** | ✅ **Wired (Jun 26)** — real post feed on the tutor profile (`TutorPostFeed`), heart wired with `liked_by_me` initial state + optimistic like/unlike. | `POST`/`DELETE /api/posts/[id]/likes`; `GET /api/tutors/[slug]/posts` (returns `liked_by_me`) |
| **B2 chat** | ✅ **Wired (Jun 27)** — real conversation list + thread (`components/chat/*`), standalone `app/messages` routes, a **"Message"** button on tutor profiles, unread badges, mark-read on open. **Delivery is REST polling** (3s in a thread, 5s on the list) — the app stays request-only, so the 0018 **Realtime publication is unused** (read-receipt RLS from 0018 IS used). Entry points: seeker **Account → Messages**, tutor **Chat tab**, tutor-profile **Message**. | `POST /api/conversations`, `GET`/`POST/PATCH /api/conversations/[id]/messages`, `GET /api/conversations` |

> **Backend change during wiring:** `GET /api/tutors?gender=` now accepts a **comma-separated list**
> (match ANY), matching the FilterSheet's multi-select gender — consistent with `district`/`language`.
>
> **Real now:** both Search tabs (seeker + tutor) over `GET /api/tutors`, both Saved + the tutor-profile
> post-feed likes, **and chat both ways** — a tutor's Search → a real tutor profile → the **Message**
> button, so **tutor↔tutor find + message works** (as does seeker→tutor). A tutor only appears in search
> once **published**.
> **Still sample data (the H2 "leave Home as-is" decision):** the seeker **Home** feed + its like/save
> buttons only. Wiring that is the same "make the feed real" work, deferred.
>
> **Migrations applied:** `0017_saved_tutors.sql` (H3), `0018_chat_realtime.sql` (B2), and
> `0019_counter_triggers_security_definer.sql` (likes-counter fix found in verification) are all live.

## I. Subscription tiers & contact gating — ✅ BUILT + LIVE (migrations 0024–0030 applied + verified)

New monetization model (tutor-side only; seekers never charged). Tutors have a
**tier** (free / premium / deluxe). Built per the app owner's decisions:
enforce server-side, write migrations for manual apply, wire the frontend too.
**Cross-side "match tracking" was intentionally left frontend-only** (per-device).

- **I1 — Tutor tier** · migration **`0024_tutor_tier.sql`** (`tutor_profiles.tier`
  text + CHECK, default `free`). `GET /api/auth/me` surfaces it via `select('*')`;
  `GET /api/tutors/[slug]` now selects `tier` (drives WhatsApp/WeChat visibility to
  seekers — free hides them). Setter: **`PATCH /api/tutor/tier`** (the app's temp
  switcher). No payments yet.
- **I2 — Contact quota + unlocks** · migration **`0025_contact_unlocks.sql`**
  (`tutor_contact_unlocks` table, owner-only RLS + the `get_seeker_for_tutor` RPC).
  Daily allowance from tier: **free 0 / premium 1 / deluxe 3**. Routes:
  **`GET /api/tutor/contact-quota`** (`{remaining, unlocked}`, UTC day reset) +
  **`POST /api/tutor/contact-unlocks`** (`{seeker_id}`; idempotent; **403** out of
  quota — the app reverts its optimistic unlock only on 403). An unlock is
  permanent per seeker.
- **I3 — Seeker read for tutors** · **`GET /api/seekers/[id]`** → the `Seeker`
  shape, via the `SECURITY DEFINER` **`get_seeker_for_tutor`** RPC (needed because
  `child_profiles` are owner-only/minors). Any signed-in tutor may read a seeker's
  prefs/child (Req: all tiers); the **phone is gated behind an unlock**. ⚠️
  **Privacy note:** this is the first surface that exposes a parent's child
  (name/level/age) to a non-owner tutor — an intentional product decision (Req 3).
  Tighten later if needed (e.g. restrict to seekers who messaged/viewed the tutor).
- **I4 — Server-side reply gating** · `POST /api/conversations/[id]/messages` now
  **403s a tutor** messaging a seeker they haven't unlocked (free tutors can't
  unlock → can't reply). Seekers reply free; tutor↔tutor ungated.
- **I5 — Profile views ("who viewed you")** · migration **`0026_profile_views.sql`**
  + **`POST /api/tutors/[slug]/views`** (upsert) + **`GET /api/tutor/profile-views`**
  (`{viewers}`, seekers only, most-recent first).
- **I6 — Tutor saved people (mixed)** · migration **`0027_saved_people.sql`** +
  **`GET/POST /api/saved/people`** + **`DELETE /api/saved/people/[id]`** (tutors AND
  seekers; tutor id is returned as the slug). Distinct from `saved_tutors` (0017).
- **I7 — Child age** · migration **`0028_child_age.sql`** (`child_profiles.age` +
  `complete_onboarding` CREATE OR REPLACE — 0023 body verbatim + the one `age`
  line). `POST /api/onboarding` now maps `child.age`; `GET /api/auth/me` + the
  seeker RPC return it.

**Status (updated Jul 1):** ✅ **applied + live + verified** — migrations `0024`–`0030`
are all applied to live Supabase (0030 was added later; see I8). Every endpoint is
wired; the tier persists via `PATCH /api/tutor/tier` and reads back from `me`/`getTutor`,
the daily quota + permanent unlocks are real, and chat reply gating is enforced server-side.

### I8 — Revised (Jun 30): seeker visibility, gating correction, seeker search

App-owner corrections to I3/I5 + two new seeker privacy toggles. **0025 was edited
to the unlocks table only** (its RPC moved to 0029, which the RPC now depends on).

- **0029_seeker_visibility.sql** — `profiles += is_discoverable, share_personal_info`
  (both default true). Revised **`get_seeker_for_tutor`**: a seeker is visible when
  **public (is_discoverable) OR they've messaged the tutor**; name/age/level/child &
  phone are withheld unless **share_personal_info** (phone also needs an unlock). New
  **`search_seekers`** RPC backs **`GET /api/seekers`** (search public seekers; full
  filters q/subcategory/level/district).
- **Reply/seeker-read gate** is now message-based for private seekers (was open to all).
- **Profile-views tiering** (`GET /api/tutor/profile-views`): **free = locked**,
  **premium = count + anonymized list**, **deluxe = full details (public viewers only)**.
- **Routes:** `PATCH /api/profiles/me` + `POST /api/onboarding` accept the two toggles.
- **Apply order:** 0024 → 0025 → 0026 → 0027 → 0028 → **0029** → **0030** (revoke the
  seeker RPCs from `anon`). ✅ **All applied + live-tested** — the 3 RPCs
  (get_seeker_for_tutor, search_seekers + the per-viewer deluxe path) are live.

## My overall recommendation (if you want a default path)

1. **Build group A now** (A1, A2, A4, A5; decide A3) — you're already collecting this
   data and currently losing it. Highest value, lowest effort.
2. **Build B1 (likes) and D1/D2/D4 (real search filters)** next — small, and the UI
   already expects them.
3. **Turn on B2 (chat) when you're ready** for messaging to be real.
4. **Park groups C, E, F** as product decisions — most are prototype polish (stories,
   follows, analytics, payments) that need a business call before any engineering. C4
   (reviews) and C6 (verification) are the two worth scheduling deliberately later.

Mark the "Your call" column and I'll build the ✅ items.
